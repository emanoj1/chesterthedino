            <p>Diplodocus, colossal creatures of the prehistoric era, roamed the Earth from approximately 161.2 million years ago to 145 million years ago. 
                Discovered in 1877 by S. W. Williston, their fossils unveiled a remarkable species defined by elongated heads, lengthy tails, and robust legs. 
                The largest Diplodocus specimen known measures a staggering 25 meters in length (80 feet) with a body mass exceeding 14 metric tons. 
                These gentle giants were strict herbivores, exclusively feasting on plant matter.</p>
